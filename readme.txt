Images size.

= Get first image of post =
If you don't want to use custom field, plugin will get first image from your post content.

Plugin gets first attached image of post.

= Default image =
If post has no image, plugin display this image. Ex: http://www.yakupgovler.com/default-image.png


Notice: If you use three options, plugin uses custom field image firstly. If the post has no custom field, it gets first image from content. At last it gets first attached image. I suggest not to use "Get first image of post" for performance. It queries much more.
